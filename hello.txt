How to Get YouTube Credential Files
Based on your project, you need three JSON files. Here's how to obtain each one:

1. 
youtube_credentials.json
 (OAuth 2.0 Client ID)
This is your main API credentials file from Google Cloud Console.

Steps:
Go to Google Cloud Console
Create a new project:
Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
Name it: "YouTube Video Uploader" (or any name)
Click "Create"
Enable YouTube Data API v3:
Go to: APIs & Services → Library
Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
Click on it → Click "Enable"
Configure OAuth Consent Screen:
Go to: APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen
Choose "External" → Click "Create"
Fill in:
App name: "YouTube Video Uploader"
User support email: Your email
Developer contact: Your email
Click "Save and Continue"
Add your email as a test user
Click "Save and Continue"
Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID:
Go to: APIs & Services → Credentials
Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
Application type: "Desktop app"
Name: "YouTube Uploader"
Click "Create"
Download the JSON file:
Click the download icon (⬇️) next to your newly created OAuth client
Rename it to: 
youtube_credentials.json
Move it to your project root: c:\Users\2002\CascadeProjects\project\perfectly uploading to youtube auto successfully but before github setup(renamed only)\
2. youtube_token.json (Auto-generated)
This file is automatically created when you first authenticate.

Steps:
Make sure youtube_credentials.json is in your project root
Run your first upload:
bash
py youtube_uploader.py --video "edited/YourVideo_EDITED.mp4"
What happens:
A browser window opens automatically
Sign in with your YouTube/Google account
You'll see "This app isn't verified" warning → Click "Continue" (it's safe, it's your own app)
Click "Allow" to grant permissions
The file youtube_token.json is automatically created in your project root
Future uploads: No browser needed, it uses the saved token
3. google_credentials.json (For other Google services)
This appears to be for other Google API services in your project (not YouTube-specific).


we will use same google credentials for google sheet ...no need to do any other thing except that browser setup,tesh paxe youtube token will be auto made by script...

youtube credentials from youtube data v3 (do not forget to add test user and publish the app ,so that the token wont expire)

google sheet ma new sheet create garne and sheet id rakhnee 

also to share the sheet with google-sheet-bot-for-youtube@fb-insta-video-upload.iam.gserviceaccount.com
